              <p>
                LeaderStreams is a product of LeaderHQ, operated by Know Freedom Technologies.
                We apply the following measures to keep your data secure:
              </p>
              <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 pl-5 list-disc">
                <li>
                  <strong>Encryption in transit.</strong> All data between your device and
                  our servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. We do not serve the
                  application over unencrypted HTTP.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Encryption at rest.</strong> Stored data — including content queues,
                  account information, and social platform tokens — is encrypted at rest in our
                  database infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Access controls.</strong> Internal access to production data is
                  restricted to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis. We do not
                  grant broad database access to staff without a legitimate operational
                  requirement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Authentication.</strong> User accounts are protected by
                  password-plus-OTP two-factor authentication. Passwords are hashed using
                  industry-standard algorithms; we never store plaintext passwords.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Vendor security.</strong> We use reputable, SOC 2-compliant
                  infrastructure providers. Third-party services we integrate with are
                  assessed for security posture before use.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <Section title="Lawful basis for processing (GDPR Article 6)">
              <p>
                If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or
                another jurisdiction covered by GDPR-equivalent legislation, we process your
                personal data on the following lawful bases:

              <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 pl-5 list-disc">
                <li>
                  <strong>Contract performance.</strong> Processing necessary to provide the
                  LeaderStreams service you have signed up for — storing your content queue,
                  publishing to connected social accounts, and delivering notifications.

                <li>
                  <strong>Consent.</strong> Where we send optional marketing communications,
                  we do so only with your consent, which you may withdraw at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
